## What does a Software Developer do?

Software development refers to the sector of computer science that is dedicated to several aspects of computer software. This includes the creation, designing, deployment, and continual support of software[(IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development).
## Typical Duties and Responsibilities

A software developer is responsible for a great many things, varying on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking though, they tend to be foremost responsible for ensuring that their software's code meets assigned requirements from bosses/managers[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html). Requirements will naturally vary depending on the project and program being developed, but things like the functionality, ease-of-use, and speed of development are to be expected as software desirables.
## Required Education
According to the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html), one or more of the following items are generally required for an ordinary career in the Canadian software development industry:
* Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus
* Master’s Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus.
* A technologist diploma or a professional technologist equivalency designation with a software or network/computer security focus
* A presentable and sufficient combination of education, training and experience with technology

## Neccesary Skills
The skills required for software development can be split into the technical and non-technical skill sets that will commonly be sought out by employers: 
### __Technical Skills__
Technical skills are largely delegated to proficiency with programming; recent experience with one or more of the following is a valuable asset as their presence will be common in a software development environment[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html):
* Python
* Perl
* Java
* C#
* C
* C++
* Swift
* Assembler
* Bash
* Shell
* HTML
* ASP
* JSP

Aside from experience with the above programming tools, the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html) also recommends further experience with technical design of software systems, as well as experience with the analysis of program requirements. The former is needed for processes in software development like planning and brainstorming, while the latter is needed to create time and cost estimates for a software developer's work[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html).
### __Non-Technical Skills__
Non-technical skills refer to the more general skills, qualities, and characteristics  will prove especially valuable to a software developer.
1. An analytical and adaptable mind[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)
    * Provides software developers with advantageous prowess with complex technologies and software that would be present[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)
2. Problem solving skills[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Ensures that the software developer can effectively find their way out of any problem which arises in their code[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html).
    * Also helps with designing aspects, as the initial creation of software tends to stem from the need to solve a problem [(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
3. Communication skills[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Software development necessitates teamwork and cooperation, as several people are often needed for larger projects and programs for various purposes[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Communication is needed to relay important information, such as a developer's personal contributions, both internally within the team, as well as externally to other departments[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)

### Length of Degree 
This program is especially long as a result of six neccesary, intermittent terms of work, as a part of University of Waterloo's co-op program.

As such, a total of __four and a half years__ are required to become a graduate of the program.


## 3 Valuable Learning Oppurtunities
A rather worthwhile endeavor is __experiential learning__. Experiential learning involves acquiring unique experience outside of a standard education, which can provide critical advantages in the eyes of prospective employers. The following are three ways in which valuable software development experience can be gained outside of traditional schooling:

__1. Co-op programs__

An example of a co-op program is that of University of Waterloo[(University of Waterloo, “Software Engineering | Co-Op”)](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/undergraduate-students/co-op). Co-op is a service that can be provided by educational institutions for an alternative learning experience to the typical school program, wherein additional time in the school year is allocated to work terms[(University of Waterloo, “Software Engineering | Co-Op”)](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/undergraduate-students/co-op). This provides accessible, entry-level work experience for students entering the industry, which proves exceptionally beneficial by providing both on-the-job, experiential learning, as well as job experience that can be put on a resume[(University of Waterloo, “Software Engineering | Co-Op”)](https://uwaterloo.ca/software-engineering/undergraduate-students/co-op).

__2. Internships__

In a rather similar vein to Co-ops, finding an internship can be a worthwhile endeavor to gain some experience. Internships are entry-level, short-term jobs which are offered to provide individuals with valuable experience in a particular industry/field[(Zhang)](https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-is-an-internship-definition-advice). In contrast with Co-op, an internship is far shorter term at a place of employment, which provides benefits for students who wish to gain a wider array of experiential learning from different employers and/or industries[(Indeed Editorial Team)](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/co-op-vs-internship). 

__3. Coding Contests__

Coding contests, such as [those regularly held by Google](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/), are good sources of  practice, competition, and possibly even notoriety. Winning isn't even necessary to gain value, as certain pertinent skills can be honed through competing. For instance, [Google's Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) encourages teamwork and cooperation, as well as problem solving skills[(Google)](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/).
