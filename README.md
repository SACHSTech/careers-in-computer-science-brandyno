## What does a Software Developer do?

Software development refers to the sector of computer science that is dedicated to several aspects of computer software. This includes the creation, designing, deployment, and continual support of software[(IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development).
## Typical Duties and Responsibilities

A software developer is responsible for a great many things, varying on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking though, they tend to be foremost responsible for ensuring that their software's code meets assigned requirements from bosses/managers[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html). Requirements will naturally vary depending on the project and program being developed, but things like the functionality, ease-of-use, and speed of development are to be expected as software desirables.
## Required Education
According to the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html), one or more of the following items are generally required for an ordinary career in the Canadian software development industry:
* Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus
* Master’s Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus.
* A technologist diploma or a professional technologist equivalency designation with a software or network/computer security focus
* A presentable and sufficient combination of education, training and experience with technology

## Neccesary Skills
The skills required for software development can be split into the technical and non-technical skill sets that will commonly be sought out by employers: 
### __Technical Skills__
Technical skills are largely delegated to proficiency with programming; recent experience with one or more of the following is a valuable asset as their presence will be common in a software development environment[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html):
* Python
* Perl
* Java
* C#
* C
* C++
* Swift
* Assembler
* Bash
* Shell
* HTML
* ASP
* JSP

Aside from experience with the above programming tools, the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html) also recommends further experience with technical design of software systems, as well as experience with the analysis of program requirements. The former is needed for processes in software development like planning and brainstorming, while the latter is needed to create time and cost estimates for a software developer's work[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html).
### __Non-Technical Skills__
Non-technical skills refer to the more general skills, qualities, and characteristics  will prove especially valuable to a software developer.
1. An analytical and adaptable mind[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)
    * Provides software developers with advantageous prowess with complex technologies and software that would be present[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)
2. Problem solving skills[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Ensures that the software developer can effectively find their way out of any problem which arises in their code[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html).
    * Also helps with designing aspects, as the initial creation of software tends to stem from the need to solve a problem [(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
3. Communication skills[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Software development necessitates teamwork and cooperation, as several people are often needed for larger projects and programs for various purposes[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html)
    * Communication is needed to relay important information, such as a developer's personal contributions, both internally within the team, as well as externally to other departments[(Robert Half Talent Solutions)](https://www.roberthalf.com.au/employers/it-technology/software-developer-jobs#:~:text=Researching%2C%20designing%2C%20implementing%2C%20and,Writing%20and%20implementing%20efficient%20code)

[(University of Waterloo, “Software Engineering”)](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/sites/ca.future-students/files/uploads/images/eng-software-engineering.jpg)
### Entrance Requirements:
According to the [Ontario Universities' Application Centre](https://www.ontariouniversitiesinfo.ca/programs/354), the following is either required or recommended for entrance into University of Waterloo's software engineering program.
* A final grade of at least 70% is required for: 
    * MHF4U
    * MCV4U
    * SCH4U
    * ENG4U 
    * SPH4U 
    * 1 additional 4U/M course,(e.g ICS4U) 
* An online video interview is recommended 
* Evidence of experience in developing well-structured, modular programs is required, e.g:
    * strong performance in a programming course such as ICS3U, ICS4U, or equivalent
    * strong performance in a programming contest
    * significant work experience

### First Year Courses
The [University of Waterloo's   website](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/software-engineering?utm_source=mur-einfo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mur-ouac) describes the first year courses as "a mix of foundational courses in computer engineering, computer science, and math". The exact courses a first year student takes are displayed on the [University of Waterloo, “Courses for Your Software Engineering Degree”](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/courses/software-engineering) page. Courses include a clear focus on __engineering__, __mathematics__, and __computer science__. There are two CS courses, 4 math courses, 2 SE courses, and 4 ECE courses. Furthermore, many of these courses show clear overlap between subjects. This is evident in courses such as the math course "_Calculus 1 for Engineering_", or the CS course "_Introduction to Data Abstraction and Implementation_".
#### The following list is ripped from [(University of Waterloo, “Courses for Your Software Engineering Degree”)](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/courses/software-engineering), and includes the standard courses for each semester of a software developer's first year:

**September to December:**
* CS 137 – Programming Principles
* ECE 105 – Classical Mechanics
* MATH 115 – Linear Algebra for Engineering
* MATH 117 – Calculus 1 for Engineering
* MATH 135 – Algebra for Honours Mathematics
* SE 101 – Introductions to Methods of Software Engineering

**January to April**:
* CS 138 – Introduction to Data Abstraction and Implementation
* ECE 106 – Electricity and Magnetism 
*  ECE 124 – Digital Circuits and Systems 
* ECE 140 – Linear Circuits
* MATH 119 – Calculus 2 for Engineering
*  SE 102 – Seminar 

### Length of Degree 
This program is especially long as a result of six neccesary, intermittent terms of work, as a part of University of Waterloo's co-op program.

As such, a total of __four and a half years__ are required to become a graduate of the program.
