# __SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:__
## What does a Software Developer do?

Software development refers to the sector of computer science that is dedicated to several aspects of computer software. This includes the creation, designing, deployment, and continual support of software[(IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development).
## Typical Duties and Responsibilities

A software developer is responsible for a great many things, varying on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking though, they tend to be foremost responsible for ensuring that their software's code meets assigned requirements from bosses/managers[(Government of Canada)](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html). Requirements will naturally vary depending on the project and program being developed, but things like the functionality, ease-of-use, and speed of development are to be expected as software desirables.
## Required Education
According to the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/csis-jobs/available-jobs/it-software-developer.html), one or more of the following items are generally required for an ordinary career in the Canadian software development industry:
* Undergraduate Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus
* Master’s Degree in Computer Science or Engineering, with a software or network/computer security focus.
* A technologist diploma or a professional technologist equivalency designation with a software or network/computer security focus
* A presentable and sufficient combination of education, training and experience with technology
